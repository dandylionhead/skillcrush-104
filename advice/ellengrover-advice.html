			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<a href = "http://i.imgur.com/gqRDJ0F.gifv"><h4>This is how you will feel every time you solve a problem</h4></a>
			<p>Just don't actually yell that every time you do something right.</p>

			<h4>Don't work in a dark room!</h4>
			<p>You may want to work into the wee hours of the night on all your beautiful code, but if you do you should turn on a light. Otherwise your code may burn your eyeballs and you will walk around for the rest of your life with shriveled up raisin eyeballs.</p>
